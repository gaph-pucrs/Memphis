 * MEMPHIS VERSION - 8.0 - support for RT applications
 *
 * Distribution:  June 2016
 *
 * Created by: Marcelo Ruaro - contact: marcelo.ruaro@acad.pucrs.br
 *
 * Research group: GAPH-PUCRS   -  contact:  fernando.moraes@pucrs.br
 *
 * \brief Defines structures Application, Task, and Dependence.
 *
 * \detailed The Application structure is useful to the kernel_master to manage the applications' information.
 * This structure is also composed of the substructures: Task and Dependece.
 * Task stores the specific information of each applications's task
 * Dependence stores the task communication dependence information.
